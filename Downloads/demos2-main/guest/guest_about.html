        <h2>About Our University Event Portal</h2>
        <p>
            The University Event Portal is designed to connect students, faculty, and staff with all ongoing and upcoming university events.
            Our goal is to encourage participation, collaboration, and campus engagement by providing an easy-to-use platform for event registration and management.
        </p>

        <p>
            Whether you’re interested in university-hosted academic conferences, student-led club activities, or networking sessions, the Event Portal makes it simple to stay informed and involved.
        </p>

        <p>
            We believe that university life extends beyond the classroom — and through this platform, we aim to create a vibrant and active student community.
